## Introduction

Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm currently an undergraduate student in **Electrical Engineering** at the University of Campinas (FEEC/Unicamp).

My main interests are wireless communications and signal processing, and their intersection with machine learning and data science. I also have experience in experimental physics and embedded systems.

## Repositories

My current repositories are organized as follows:

1. **Unicamp**: personal codes I've written as part of disciplines from my undergraduate course.
2. **Teaching**: personal codes used for teaching assistance. 
3. **Hackathons**: team codes I've used as part of other repositories during hackathon competitions. The final repositories are usually also forked.
