## Introduction

Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm currently a Master's student in **Electrical Engineering** at Télécom SudParis, Institut Polytechnique de Paris, in a double degree program with the University of Campinas (Unicamp).

My main interests are RF, antennas, wireless communications, and signal processing. The codes below usually deal with the intersection between these areas and computer simulations, machine learning, and data science in general.

All codes that are part of bigger projects were approved before upload. Any corrections, suggestions, and feedback should be addressed via e-mail.

## Repositories

My current repositories are organized as follows:

1. **Unicamp**: codes I've written as part of disciplines from my undergraduate course.
2. **Telecom SudParis**: codes from the courses at Télécom SudParis from September 2024 - July 2025.
3. **Teaching**: personal codes used for teaching assistance. 
4. **Hackathons**: team codes I've used as part of other repositories during hackathon competitions. The final repositories are usually also forked.
